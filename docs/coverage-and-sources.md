# Channel coverage

Comparison between our channel counts and **Wikipedia – List of countries by number of television broadcast stations** (broadcast stations, various years). Full list: countries with a Wikipedia reference are sorted by that reference (descending); "Gap" indicates where our list is below that potential.

Countries without a Wikipedia reference (—) are listed at the end. To refresh this table, run: `node scripts/count-channels.js --markdown`.

### Increasing coverage (below 95% of ref.)

To add channels from iptv-org for countries below 95% of the Wikipedia reference:

```bash
node scripts/enrich-coverage-from-iptv-org.js
```

Use `--dry-run` to see what would be added. For many countries (e.g. Russia, China, Spain) iptv-org has fewer channel names than we already have, so 95% may require other sources:

**Wikipedia** (recommended for countries below 95%):

```bash
node scripts/enrich-coverage-from-wikipedia.js
```

Follows redirects (e.g. "List of television stations" → "List of television channels"). Use `--dry-run` or `--only=CODE` to test.

**epg.best** (may hit rate limit 429; run sparingly):

```bash
node scripts/enrich-coverage-from-epg-best.js
```
